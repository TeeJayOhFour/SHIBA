*Stupidly Horrendous Implementation of Basic Animations*
![Temporary splash Art for Engine which was taken from the internet.](https://github.com/TeeJayOhFour/SHIBA/blob/master/SHIBA-Migrated/assets/textures/engine.png?raw=true)

Shiba is a work-in-progress game engine made using OpenGL and GLUT.
This engine was made by **TJ (21204009)** for a joint project in multiple courses with the following contributors:
- Ishraq (21204001)
- Nihima (21204002)
- Zaki (21204010)

## âš  Warning
This was a rush job which resulted in sub-optimal implementation of various programming concepts. It's not pretty but it's functional. There's a lot of work left before it can be used freely as an engine for other games.

### The textures and splash are are public domain and are being used solely for testing purposes and will be removed/replaced with royalty free ones in final release.
